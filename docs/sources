		Contains equations of the discrete cosine transform as well as the inverse discrete cosine transform on page 10. I've only looked at this briefly (and up to this part) but the equation for the DCT (discrete cosine transform) contains another equation (F(u, v), the DCT coefficient) which seems to be defined on the previous page, but the equation for F(u,v) contains the other equation.

	DevILL/OpenCV, still not sure which one is better, CV seems better documented though so I might try that:

		OpenCV Documentiaion/tutorial
	http://www.geeks3d.com/20090105/tutorial-how-to-load-and-display-an-image-with-devil-and-opengl/
		Really quick tutorial on DevIL
	http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php
		install DevIL
